#Postmortem
##Issue Summary:
Our web stack encountered a 2-hour outage, starting at 09:00 AM UTC on December 5, 2023, affecting 20% of users accessing our collaborative document editing platform. Users experienced difficulty in saving changes and encountered synchronization issues. The root cause was identified as a backend server misconfiguration that disrupted data synchronization.

##Timeline:
The issue was first noticed at 09:00 AM UTC when users reported difficulties saving changes. The engineering team initiated an investigation, initially suspecting a database issue. However, by 09:30 AM UTC, it became evident that the problem was related to data synchronization. The incident was escalated to the Backend and DevOps teams. Further investigation revealed that a recent configuration change on a backend server disrupted the synchronization process. The misconfiguration was corrected by reverting the recent update at 10:30 AM UTC, and services were fully restored by 11:00 AM UTC.

##Corrective and Preventative Measures:
To prevent a recurrence, a comprehensive review process for backend server configuration changes was implemented. This involves mandatory peer reviews and automated tests to ensure synchronization integrity. Enhanced monitoring alerts were introduced to promptly identify anomalies in data synchronization, and documentation for backend server configurations was updated for clarity. A post-incident review session was conducted to analyze the outage, documenting the incident's impact and implementing corrective measures. These actions aim to bolster the reliability of our collaborative document editing platform and enhance our response to similar issues in the future.
