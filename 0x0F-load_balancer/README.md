# Load BAlancing

Load balancing is a technique used in computer networking and server infrastructure to distribute incoming network traffic or workload across multiple servers or resources. The primary goal of load balancing is to ensure that no single server or resource becomes overwhelmed with traffic, which can lead to performance degradation or downtime, while also optimizing resource utilization.
